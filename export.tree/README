Within this study the EOG channels from two previous studies were pooled. 
20 participants from Jaeger et al. (2020) and 21 from Holtze et al. (2021) were included. 
Participants performed a two-competing speaker paradigm in both original studies. 
Participants were instructed to either attend to the left or right audio book. 
The paradigm consisted of six (Jaeger et al. 2020) or five (Holtze et al. 2021) 
10-minute blocks of audio book presentation. In Jaeger et al. (2020) both audio 
books were always presented equally loud. In Holtze et al. 2021, a 10-minute block could 
 either be presented in the omnidirectional condition (both audio books were presented 
equally loud) or in the beamforming condition (the to-be-attended audio book 
was louder than the to-be-ignored audio book). The first 10-minute block was always 
presented in the omnidirectional condition whereas the conditions were alternated 
for the later four blocks, with one half of the participants starting with the 
omnidirectonal condition and the other half starting with the beamforming condition
